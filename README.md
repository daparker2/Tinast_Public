#Introduction 
This my car dash panel project. It's for my flashed ECU 2013 Subaru BRZ. It probably won't work on anything else. The LCD has a touchscreen, but Windows IoT won't support the nonstandard 1024x600 resolution, so the touchscreen will probably never work right.

There will be some limited customization of PIDs in a json file, but probably no way to deploy changes there without branching. There might be limited datalogging but we're pretty much a long way from that.

##BOM
1. Raspberry Pi 3
